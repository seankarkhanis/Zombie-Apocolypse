The idea of a zombie apocalypse, though fictional, offers a compelling opportunity to
explore mathematical modeling of dynamic systems. In this report, we examine how a zombie
outbreak could unfold by analyzing four distinct scenarios, each based on different assumptions
about infection rates, human survival, and intervention strategies. To model these scenarios, we
apply well-established mathematical frameworks, including the Predator-Prey (Lotka-V olterra)
model and SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) models, adapting them to fit the unique
features of a zombie apocalypse.
